## Welcome to the Unofficial Guide to Seoul for ICSE 2020

This guide is designed to help those who will be visiting Seoul for ICSE 2020 regarding things like finding the vegetarian options, good coffee, and other things to do in general. The guide is initiated by [COINSE](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/index.html).

### Where to eat

While all types of vegetarianism is growing increasingly popular, contemporary Korean cuisine is on average not really that vegeratian friendly. Here are some of the vegetarian/vegan restaurants that are not too far from the conference venue.

- [Plant](https://www.plantcafeseoul.com): salads, wraps, sandwiches, as well as veggie burgers, lentil bowls, pasta, and baked stuff. Reserve by phone ( 02-749-1981, will speak English). 
- [Parc Seoul](https://www.parcseoul.com): not entirely a vegetarian place, but they will always have a vegetarian option in traditional home cooking style. English speaking staffs. Reserve by phone or online (02-792-2022
).
- [Magpie Brewery (Itaewon Branch)](http://www.magpiebrewing.com): this is a local microbrewery that is very popular, but they also serve vegetarian pizzas in the basement so a must-go place if you want to sample the local beer scene. Can be crowded in the weekends.  (02-749-2703)
- [Balwoo Gongyang](http://eng.balwoo.or.kr): this place specialises in traditional Buddhist temple style food - the name refers to the traditional way Buddhist monks eat at temple, while contemplating the life of Buddha. They provide a range of course from 30,000 KRW all the way up to 150,000 KRW. (02-733-2081). <i class="material-icons" style="font-size:36px">place</i>
